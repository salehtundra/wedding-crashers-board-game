Wedding Crashers Board Game

=======
Synopsis:
The Bride wants the perfect wedding and she has a few simple rules. No one gets hammered or sleeps with anyone. 
Little did she know a bunch of nefarious actors were invited to her wedding and are after the Groom. 
If she so much as hears the Groom had a fun night before the wedding the wedding is off.
You the players must either crash the wedding or protect the integrity of the wedding. 

=======
How to play:
Gamemaster, Bridezilla, Groom, and at least one Stripper role are required to be in the group of cards the players choose from.
The rest can be randomly taken. 
Gamemaster sets up the board.
Players write down their names and roles on the event log listing card.
Gamemaster reqeusts the event log listing cards frome everyone and writes down anything he needs to.
The game is divided into day and night cycles. 
During the day cycle players are free to say whatever, Gamemaster can moderate. 
During the day the good players goal should be to try to kick evil role players from the wedding.
Evil role players goals should be trying to get the good role players kicked.
A vote can be determined on whether or not a person should be kicked by everyone around. Votes can keep chaning until either everyone gives up on voting or someone is voted out.
The gamemaster then changes the cycle to the night.
During the night cycle every player writes what role ability they used and on who in the event card. They also write who they chose to have a drink with at night in the event card.
Then they throw the event cards face down in a center pile.
Gamemaster gets all the event cards, figures out who did what and what effect canceled out what, then writes down the response action and gives each event card back to the player.
At any time in game a player can write notes in the RSVP Notes Listing; this can be anything from helpful information for the good or evil side or a crude drawing of a dickbutt.
Gamemaster changes back to the day cycle, returns event cards, and process repeats.
Play continues until conditions for evil or good victory occur.
When a player is eliminated they can display their role card and their RSVP Notes Listing.

=======
How to win:
For the evil side to win all good roles must be voted out or removed during the night or turned to an evil role.
For the good side to win all evil roles must be voted out.
For the neutral roles the condition is written below and on the card.

=======
Alternate rules:
When a player is eliminated they only show thier RSVP Notes Listing. So no one can be sure of which role the person belonged to.

The gamemaster can tell the players what roles are in the current game for process of elimination deductive reasoning.

=======
Role Abilities:
Most roles have an ability that can be triggered either during the day or the night. Night abilities are written on the event card before the gamemaster retrieves all the event cards.
Everyone must choose to drink with another person at night. The Pimp Daddy and the Crazy Uncle will trigger their abilities as part of the drink process.
Some roles have an ability that lets them gain information from the gamemaster before the first day begins.
If the Pimp Daddy or Crazy Uncle visit someone without a drink token, the target receives a drink token the next day.
