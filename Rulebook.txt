Wedding Crashers Board Game

=======
Synopsis:
The Bride wants the perfect wedding and she has a few simple rules. No one gets hammered or sleeps with anyone. 
Little did she know a bunch of nefarious actors were invited to her wedding and are after the Groom. 
If she so much as hears the Groom had a fun night before the wedding the wedding is off.
You the players must either crash the wedding or protect the integrity of the wedding. 

=======
How to play:
Gamemaster, Bridezilla, Groom, and at least one Stripper role are required to be in the group of cards the players choose from.
The rest can be randomly taken. 
Gamemaster sets up the board.
Players write down their names and roles on the event log listing card.
Gamemaster reqeusts the event log listing cards frome everyone and writes down anything he needs to.
The game is divided into day and night cycles. 
During the day cycle players are free to say whatever, Gamemaster can moderate. 
During the day the good players goal should be to try to kick evil role players from the wedding.
Evil role players goals should be trying to get the good role players kicked.
A vote can be determined on whether or not a person should be kicked by everyone around. Votes can keep chaning until either everyone gives up on voting or someone is voted out.
The gamemaster then changes the cycle to the night.
During the night cycle every player writes what role ability they used and on who in the event card. They also write who they chose to have a drink with at night in the event card.
Then they throw the event cards face down in a center pile.
Gamemaster gets all the event cards, figures out who did what and what effect canceled out what, then writes down the response action and gives each event card back to the player.
At any time in game a player can write notes in the RSVP Notes listing they get; this can be anything from helpful information for the good or evil side or a crude drawing of a dickbutt.
Gamemaster changes back to the day cycle and process repeats.
Play continues until conditions for evil or good victory occur.
