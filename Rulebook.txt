Bachelor Party wedding game

Synopsis:
The Bride wants the perfect wedding and she has a few simple rules. No one gets hammered or sleeps with anyone. 
Little did she know a bunch of nefarious actors were invited to her wedding and are after the Groom. 
If she so much as hears the Groom had a fun night before the wedding the wedding is off.
You the players must either crash the wedding or protect the integrity of the wedding. 

How to play:
Gamemaster, Bridezilla, Groom, and at least one Stripper role are required to be in the group of cards the players choose from.
The rest can be randomly taken. 
Gamemaster sets up the board.
Players write down their names and roles on the event log listing card. 
The game is divided into day and night cycles. 
During the day cycle players are free to say whatever, Gamemaster can moderate. 
During the day the good players goal should be to try to kick evil role players from the wedding.
Evil role players goals should be trying to get the good role players kicked.
The gamemaster then changes the cycle.
During the night cycle every player writes what role ability they used and on who or stuff on their RSVP letter and in the event card then throws them face down in a center pile.
Gamemaster gets all the event cards, figures out who did what and what effect canceled out what, then writes down the response action and gives each event card back to the player.
At any time in game a player can write notes in the Notes listing they get; this can be anywhere from helpful information for the good or evil side or a crude drawing of a dickbutt.
Play continues until Groom is eliminated or all evil roles are kicked out of the wedding.

How to win:
For the evil side the Groom needs to be killed by the Bridezilla by sleeping with an evil role, getting hit by the crazy uncle ability, or getting kicked during the day.
